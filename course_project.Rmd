## Project 1: Species Distribution Model
### Habitat Modeling for Blue Rockfish, Carmel Bay, California

### Introduction
This course project came from my Marine GIS course in Spring 2020. In this project, I built up two species distribution models for endangered blue rockfish from Carmel Bay, California, using both generalized linear regression model (GLM) and generalized additive regression model (GAM). I then compared the results from both models and made suggestions to relevant authorities regarding the best place to build marine protected area to protect the species.

### Method
General analyzing process includes generating psuedo absence points for blue rockfish, building up GLM and GAM using R (based on chosen independent variables and presence/absence data of blue rockfish), and presenting the result in ArcGIS pro.
