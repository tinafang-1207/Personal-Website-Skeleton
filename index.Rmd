I am currently a Ph.D. student at [Bren School of Environmental Science and Management](https://bren.ucsb.edu/people/yutian-fang), UC Santa Barbara. My research interest largely focuses on marine conservation and fishery management, with intersections between dynamic ocean management, marine spatial planning and fishery bycatch reduction. I received my Bachelor of Science degree in marine biology from UC San Diego in 2019, and Master of Environmental Management degree from Duke University in 2021.
